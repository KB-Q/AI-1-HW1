In this assignment, we have two different datasets, one with car data in Part 1 and another with data from an Indian matrimonial web site in Part 2.

For part 1, we used two simple methods for prediction, k-nearest neighbors regression (kNN), a non-parametric method, and linear regression, a parametric method. In Part 2, we worked with multiple linear and polynomial regression.
